* TODO Tests for unixcw version a.b.c
Version of template: 2023.10.16.
** TODO <Machine/OS identifier>
<More details about the machine>
*** TODO Build system tests

*Steps*
Run "make distcheck" in main directory of the project.

*Expected result*
1. Distribution package is built correctly (no errors during creation of
   archive).
2. Automatic tests executed during 'make distcheck' pass.
3. The distribution package contains all files intended for distribution (use
   your best judgement here).

**** TODO ./configure options

Test that all options supported by ./configure script produce "buildable" code.

*Steps*
Run ./qa/test_configure_options.sh

*Expected result*

The script should not report any failure.

Test of configuration flags SUCCEEDED

*Notes*
The shell script may not work on systems without bash.

*Actual result*

*** TODO libcw tests
Tests using tools from unixcw/src/libcw.

Notice that Null sound system is tested as last one: first run tests on other
sound systems that allow you to hear some sound. With a real sound from
speaker or buzzer it's easier to notice problems with libcw. Don't waste time
on testing Null system first, only to hear issues with other sound systems
later.

**** TODO Main test binary - Console sound system

*Steps*
cd src/libcw/tests
./libcw_tests -S c

*Expected results*
Test logs and summary table for tests shows only well-known problems.

*Test statistics table*

*Actual result*

**** TODO Main test binary - OSS sound system

*Steps*
cd src/libcw/tests
./libcw_tests -S o

*Expected results*
Test logs and summary table for tests shows only well-known problems.

*Test statistics table*

*Actual result*

**** TODO Main test binary - ALSA sound system

*Steps*

*Actual result*

**** TODO Main test binary - PulseAudio sound system

*Steps*
cd src/libcw/tests
./libcw_tests -S p

*Expected results*
Test logs and summary table for tests shows only well-known problems.

*Test statistics table*

*Actual result*

**** TODO Main test binary - Null sound system

*Steps*
cd src/libcw/tests
./libcw_tests -S n

*Expected results*

Test logs and summary table for tests shows only well-known problems.

*Test statistics table*

*Actual result*

**** TODO Misc tests

***** TODO pcm sample file is disabled in regular builds

Confirm that by default libcw doesn't create a debug file into which raw PCM
samples are being written.

*Steps*

1. Confirm that in /tmp there is no file called
   "cw_file_<parameters>_pcm.raw" from previous runs of programs/tests.

2. Build package
./configure && make

3. Start a program that uses libcw to generate sound. Play any string.
./src/cw/cw

4. Exit the program.

5. Confirm that in /tmp there is no file called
   "cw_file_<parameters>_pcm.raw" from _current_ run of program done in
   step 3.

*Actual result*

*** TODO cw tests
Tests of basic usage of unixcw/src/cw/cw program.

**** TODO Tests using *.cw files

Tests that use *.cw files:
./src/cw/cw -f src/cw/test.cw
./src/cw/cw -f src/cw/demo.cw
./src/cw/cw -f src/cw/prelude.cw

*Actual result*

**** TODO Tests of command-line options
Test that some of command-line options result in expected behaviour of cw.

***** TODO words per minute
./src/cw/cw -w 10
./src/cw/cw -w 50

./src/cw/cw -k 70

*Actual result*

***** TODO Null sound system

./srcw/cw/cw -s n

*Actual result*

***** TODO ALSA sound system

You may want to first kill pulseaudio and pipewire

./src/cw/cw -s a -d plughw:CARD=PCH,DEV=0

*Actual result*

***** TODO OSS sound system

You may want to first kill pulseaudio and pipewire

./src/cw/cw -s o

*Actual result*

*** TODO cwcp tests

**** TODO Tests of UI elements
***** TODO Main modes (character groups)

*Steps*
1. Select each mode (character group) item in left-hand "Modes" panel.
2. Press F9 or Enter if necessary to force start of playing.

*Expected results*
1. For each item the text in main UI area corresponds to each mode (character
   group). The words consist of intended (expected) characters from character group.
2. For each item the text is being played correctly.

*Actual results*

***** TODO "Keyboard" mode

*Steps*
1. In the left-hand "Modes" panel select "Keyboard" item.
2. Enter few words

*Expected results*
1. The entered words are visible in main UI area.
2. The words are played correctly.

*Actual results*

***** TODO Main Function-key controls

*Steps*
1. In "Mode" menu select any of character groups.
2. Let cwcp generate sound.
3. Use the function keys in range F1-F8 to control parameters of played
   sound.

*Expected results*
Parameters of newly enqueued text (speed, tone, volume, gap) behave
corresponding to a value modified through the Function keys.

*Actual results*

***** TODO Practice keys (PageDown/PageUp keys)

*Steps*
1. Using PageDown/PageUp keys select some value of practice time.
2. In "Mode" menu select any of character groups.
3. Let cwcp generate sound.

*Expected results*
1. The timer at the bottom of the UI counts practice time up.
2. When the count of minutes of practice time reaches limit set with
   PageDown/PageUp keys, the practice ends.

*Actual results*

***** TODO "Exit" key

*Steps*
1. Press F12 ("Exit") key when cwcp is idle and is not generating any text/sound.
2. Press F12 ("Exit") key when cwcp is generating text and sound.

*Expected results*
1. cwcp process is terminated.
2. No "ncurses" artifacts are visible in console window, meaning that the
   termination was "clean".
3. No error or warning messages are visible in console window

*Actual results*

*** TODO xcwcp tests

**** TODO basics
Tests of basic usage of unixcw/src/xcwcp/xcwcp program.

*** TODO cwgen tests
Tests of basic usage of unixcw/src/cwgen/cwgen program.

*** TODO receiving functionality
**** TODO xcwcp receiver tests

*Steps*
1. Enable xcwcp's receiver tests
  ./configure --enable-xcwcp-rec-test
2. Compile xcwcp
   make
3. Run xcwcp, use "Run Receiver Test" item in modes menu
   Observe console during and after execution of the test.
4. At the end of received text press "pause" button to end the test.
5. Check in console that the summary says "success":
   "[II] Test result: success"

*Expected result*
1. No errors reported in console.
2. Test's summary indicates success.
