* Terminology and conventions for code and documentation

 - Use "duration" when describing how long (in microseconds or seconds) a
   tone will last. Don't use "length" when speaking about how long (in
   microseconds or seconds) a tone will last.

 - Use "sound" when referring to sound devices, sounds systems
   (ALSA/PulseAudio, etc.) or sound outputs (sinks). Don't use "audio" in
   this context.

 - Use "inter-mark-space" when referring to space between Dots and Dashes
   within one character.  Don't use "end-of-mark space".

 - Use "inter-character-space" when referring to space between characters
   within one word. Don't use "end-of-character space".

 - Use "inter-word-space" when referring to space between words. Don't use
   "end-of-word space".

 - Variables of type cw_ret_t, returned by libcw functions, should be called
   "cwret" (or "cwret_<suffix>"). Example:

   cw_ret_t cwret = cw_tq_enqueue_internal(tq, &tone);

 - Variables of type int, returned by ALSA API functions, should be called
   "snd_rv". The "snd" prefix comes from names of ALSA functions and
   highlights the fact that the returned value comes from ALSA (snd)
   API. Example:

   int snd_rv = cw_alsa.snd_pcm_hw_params_set_channels(gen->alsa_data.pcm_handle, hw_params, CW_AUDIO_CHANNELS);
   if (0 != snd_rv) {
           cw_debug_msg (&cw_debug_object, CW_DEBUG_SOUND_SYSTEM, CW_DEBUG_ERROR,
                         MSG_PREFIX "set hw params: can't set number of channels: %s", cw_alsa.snd_strerror(snd_rv));
           return CW_FAILURE;
   }

* Operating systems

** Linux

*** Extra packages to install

mc git
Systems with X windows: xterm meld
Debian: debhelper

*** Alpine Linux

**** Installation

Instructions for installation for dual-boot scenarios:
https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Dualbooting

In a nutshell:
 1. Prepare target partition with ext4 file system and with desired size. You
    can do it in another distro, or probably you can do it from Alpine's
    installer.
 2. In Alpine installer, mount the partition to e.g. /mnt.
 3. In Alpine installer, run specified setup-* tools.
 4. In Alpine installer, install Alpine to the partition with 'setup-disk -m
    sys /mnt' command.


**** grub entry

Put this in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and run 'update-grub2':

For Alpine installed on /dev/sda8:
'a' in "sda8" translates to '0' in "hd0,8"
'8' in "sda8" translates to '8' in "hd0,8"

IIRC, UUID was probably obtained with 'blkid /dev/sda8'.

menuentry "Alpine Linux 3.17" {
	set root=(hd0,8)
	insmod ext2
	linux /boot/vmlinuz-lts root=UUID=f9f73a1c-4cc7-4aa2-b952-38735d2d0f61 modules=usb-storage,ext4
	initrd /boot/initramfs-lts
}

** FreeBSD

*** Disk space

10GB of disc space for FreeBSD 12.1 is not enough to have comfortable working
env, as I'm constantly running into "no free space left" message. 15GB or
even 20GB would be more adequate.

*** Generic tips

**** mount

Mount a pendrive
mount -t msdosfs /dev/da0s1 /mnt/

FreeBSD probably doesn't support journaling in Linux's ext filesystems, so
they have to be mounted with "-t ext2fs" option passed to "mount" command.

**** mc

When you encounter this problem when starting mc:
    common.c: unimplemented subshell type 1
    read (subshell_pty...): No such file or directory (2)
then run mc like this:
    mc -u

*** Binary packages

https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html

**** Upgrade binary packages:
pkg upgrade

**** Audit installed packages for known vulnerabilities:
pkg audit -F

**** Clean up packages:
pkg autoremove
pkg clean
pkg clean -a

**** List installed packages:
pgk info

**** Remove package
pkg remove

*** Source code packages

https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html#ports-upgrading-tools

**** Install portmaster
cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster
make install clean


**** Upgrade all outdated ports
portmaster -a
or in case of errors:
portmaster -af

*** grub entry

Put this in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and run 'update-grub2':

For FreeBSD installed on /dev/sda9:
'a' in "sda9" translates to '0' in "hd0,9"
'9' in "sda9" translates to '9' "hd0,9"

"\/dev/ada0s9a" - this you probably have to learn during installation of
FreeBSD. IIRC, this was the main slice in which root ('/') and swap
partitions were created by FreeBSD installer.

menuentry "FreeBSD 13.2" --class freebsd --class bsd --class os {
	insmod bsd
	insmod ufs2
	set root=(hd0,9)
	kfreebsd /boot/kernel/kernel
	kfreebsd_loadenv /boot/device.hints
	set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom=ufs:/dev/ada0s9a
	set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom.options=rw
}

* Sound systems
** Console

*** Linux
modprobe pcspkr
-d /dev/console

*** FreeBSD

kldload speaker
#define LIBCW_CONSOLE_USE_SPKRTONE && make
-d /dev/speaker

**** beep
Text visible after installing 'beep' package on FreeBSD 12.1:

For PC spearker sound to work you need to be in the operator group and need rw/ permissions to /dev/speaker device.

Load kernel module:
kldload speaker

Add a user to operator group:
pw groupmod operator -m jerry

Uncomment the following lines in /etc/devfs.rules file:
# Allow members of group operator to cat things to the speaker
[speaker=10]
add path 'speaker' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules add the following to /etc/rc.conf:
devfs_speaker_ruleset="speaker"

Then restart devfs to load the new rules:
/etc/rc.d/devfs restart

** ALSA
*** Accessing ALSA directly

On current Linux desktops you may need to disable PulseAudio and PipeWire.
Otherwise you may get "Device or resource busy" error when trying to access
ALSA device.

On some systems (e.g. Alpine Linux 3.18.4), pulseaudio server is started only
when PulseAudio sound system is needed, e.g. when PulseAudio sound system is
requested in command line: "./src/cw/cw -s p". After ~20 seconds of
inactivity the server is automatically stopped.

**** Disabling the servers on machines with systemd

systemctl stop --user pulseaudio.socket
systemctl stop --user pulseaudio.service

systemctl stop --user pipewire.socket
systemctl stop --user pipewire.service

*** Finding the right audio card

First find out what playback devices you have:

$ aplay -L
[...]

hw:CARD=PCH,DEV=0
    HDA Intel PCH, ALC3204 Analog
    Direct hardware device without any conversions
[...]

plughw:CARD=PCH,DEV=0
    HDA Intel PCH, ALC3204 Analog
    Hardware device with all software conversions
[...]



$ aplay -l
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC3204 Analog [ALC3204 Analog]
   Subdevices: 1/1
   Subdevice #0: subdevice #0




You probably don't want to use device without software conversions, so ignore
"hw" and use "plughw". With the above example, the following strings are
acceptable values of "-d" option:

"plughw:CARD=PCH,DEV=0"
"plughw:PCH,0"
"plughw:0,0"    <---- "PCH" looked like a label of "card 0", so "PCH" is replaced with "0".

*** Troubleshooting from the ground up

1. Use 'lspci' to see if you have a sound card.
2. Use 'lsmod | grep snd' to see if you have kernel modules for sound loaded.
3. Use modprobe (e.g. 'modprobe snd_hda_intel') to load appropriate kernel
   module if necessary.

   Sometimes unloading a module and loading it again helps:
   modprobe -r snd_hda_intel
   modprobe snd_hda_intel

4. Check which groups do /dev/snd/* devices belong to, and make sure that
   your user belongs to that group.

5. Make sure your card is not muted

   amixer -c <card no>
   amixer -c <card no> set <name (e.g. Master)> unmute

6. Use 'aplay -l' to list playback devices.

   Example:
   aplay -l
   **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
   card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: VT1708B 8-Ch Analog [VT1708B 8-Ch Analog]
     Subdevices: 0/1
     Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
   card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: VT1708B 8-Ch Digital [VT1708B 8-Ch Digital]
     Subdevices: 1/1
     Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

7. Use 'aplay -L' to learn more about your devices.

8. Use 'alsamixer' to select correct device.

   Oftentimes the initial device presented by alsamixer shows only one
   "slider". The correct device will present multiple "sliders" for input,
   output, etc. Make sure that appropriate items (siders) are not muted (use
   'm' key to toggle).

9. See if ALSA playback works (you should hear a sound)

	aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/<file>

	There is also 'paplay' tool for PulseAudio that does the same.


10. Try yet another trick with specifying device name (this comes from
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Test_your_changes):

	a. get cards with "aplay -L | grep :CARD"

	   alpine:~# aplay -L | grep :CARD
       sysdefault:CARD=Intel                 <---- this one
       front:CARD=Intel,DEV=0

    b. Run aplay with device specified by "-D". Notice that you only specify
       "card", but not "device".

	   aplay -v /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav -D sysdefault:Intel

	c. You can now run unixcw programs using the same argument as device:

	   ./libcw_tests -S a -X sysdefault:Intel

** PulseAudio

*** General comments
PA relies on ALSA.
Make sure that appropriate ALSA packages are installed.
Make sure that ALSA works correctly, refer to ALSA chapter in this file.


*** Useful commands
pamixer --list-sinks
ncpamixer
pactl list cards
pactl list sinks


*** Troubleshooing from the ground up

1. Check whether PulseAudio sees any cards
   pacmd list-cards

2. Reload kernel module for your sound card
   modprobe -r X
   modprobe X

*** Sinks

List PulseAudio sink names (names that can be passed as values of '-d'
command line switch):

LC_ALL=C pactl list | grep -A2 'Sink #' | grep 'Name: ' | cut -d" " -f2

*** Stop/start

To kill pulseaudio server and prevent it from re-starting:
emacs ~/.config/pulse/client.conf
autospawn = no
pactl exit # (or killall -9 pulseaudio)

To re-start it again:
emacs ~/.config/pulse/client.conf
autospawn = yes
pulseaudio &

*** Valgrind

Testing PulseAudio under valgrind may require setting "VALGRIND=1" env in
command line. See this thread:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42942

** OSS

*** Ubuntu

When ALSA or PulseAudio is already installed:

* Lessons learned

   1. For doing a set of tests before a release, use the test template that
      you created in qa/test_scenarios/. It's a time saver and a good way to
      organize tests.

   2. Learn how to muffle the console buzzer. It's really annoying
      during long tests.

   3. CPU usage is important, especially on older/weaker
      machines. Learn how to measure it and monitor it during
      execution of programs and tests.

   4. Lower latency of audio streams leads to higher CPU usage,
      especially for PulseAudio. Find a good way to balance these two
      things.

   5. Set limited and clear goals for each release at the beginning of
      development phase. This will allow you to avoid long development cycles
      and feature creep. Project's prerelease checklist has a point dedicated
      to this, somewhere at the begin of the dev cycle (it's called "Define
      scope of changes to be done in this release").

   6. When writing commit messages, try to formulate them in a way that will
      be easy to copy to release notes. When possible, add a summary that
      will be meaningful from user's or integrator's point of view.

   7. Maintain a section called "Quality Assurance" in changelog/NEWS file.
      Put there changes related to:
      a. increasing quality of code in the package,
      b. increasing security of program(s) compiled from the package.

      Let users know that there are specific actions taken and changes made
      to increase quality of the software that they will be using. Make the
      actions and changes more visible in the changelog/NEWS file.

   8. Sharing a partition between OSes installed on a single PC.

      1. FreeBSD can mount Linux 'ext4' filesystem, but only if you use
         'ext2fs' as type. FreeBSD doesn't support journaling on ext3/4
         filesystems.

      2. FreeBSD may have problems with running fsck_ext2 (?) on an ext2
         partition during boot up, and this will lead to FreeBSD starting in
         single-user mode (FreeBSD will want you to fix a problem with
         ext2/ext4 partition).

      3. It may be necessary to create users with the same UID and GID on all
         OSes. Otherwise 'mount' will not recognize UID and GID in mounted
         filesystem as belonging to a valid and known local user, and all
         files and directories will have 1000:1000 UID:GID.

         Consult a man page for the command creating user accounts about
         explicitly specifying UID and GID of a new user.

   9. Always assign priorities to tickets in README.dev.org

      Having tickets without priorities leads to bad prioritization of
      future work.

      Use "C-c ," in Emacs to assign priority (A/B/C) to org-mode TODO item.

   10. When you make important change to package, document it in
       NEWS/CHANGELOG immediately. Don't postpone this to last week before
       release.

	   Trying to compile NEWS items from a commit log or from other sources
       at the end of dev cycle is a dumb idea that will make you wish you
       were documenting important changes as they were happening.

* Bugs, feature requests
** DONE R0001 Bug: -lintl on Alpine is not added to linker flags

Compilation of cw on Alpine 1.17.3 is failing because linker can't find intl function:
   /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-alpine-linux-musl/12.2.1/../../../../x86_64-alpine-linux-musl/bin/ld: /home/acerion/unixcw/unixcw/src/cwutils/i18n.c:63: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'

Manually adding -lintl to linker's command line fixes the problem, so
it's a matter of getting linker flags on Alpine right.

See 'AC_CHECK_LIB(intl, textdomain)' in configure.ac - we probably already do
something to address this on for FreeBSD.



FIXED in 3.6.1 in commits f1ee07c6c5d4a0791dbf3a23a0b87f5c05c91ed3 and
b08d96a22490eccbe8acc6b71882b828682615ef. Code detecting whether to link with
intl library on Alpine and FreeBSD has been reworked a bit.

** DONE R0002 Feature: allow disabling cw and cwgen through ./configure
A problem with -lintl on Alpine shows that even such simple
application as cw can fail to build. To allow a quick workaround for
users, add "--disable-cw" to configure script.

While you are at it, add similar flag for cwgen.

DONE: --disable-cwgen and --disable-cw flags have been added in
387c68f46bc2683ae82bf1c0a56de1badb188615.

** TODO [#C] R0003 Use suseconds_t for duration variables?

** TODO [#B] R0004 Detect unusually long times when joining generator's thread

Usually it's 2-5 microseconds, anything longer may be a sign of problems.

** TODO [#C] R0005 Module prefixes of equal length

To improve readability of debug messages, all values of MSG_PREFIX (like
"libcw/gen" or "libcw/alsa") should have the same length.

** TODO [#B] R0006 Detect missing function definitions
In order to detect libcw function declarations without definitions, write a
code that tries to generate code that calls all libcw public functions. If
definition of any function declared in public header is missing, linking
phase will fail.

Rationale: today I have detected (by sheer luck) that cw_set_debug_flags()
declaration existed in libcw_debug.h, but the function was not defined
anywhere.

** TODO [#C] R0007 Don't display unsupported sound systems
Don't show in help texts ("-h") information about sound systems
disabled during compilation. Don't show ALSA/PulseAudio information on
FreeBSD.

** TODO [#B] R0008 'Enter' in cw
Just pressing 'Enter' in cw leads to calls of
gen->write_buffer_to_sound_device(). It should not.

** TODO [#A] R0009 CPU usage of pulseaudio
Verify cpu usage of "pulseadio" process when "cw" is started and is doing
nothing at all.

** TODO [#B] R0010 math library in dependencies

Look at this warning displayed when Debian packages are being built:

dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: package could avoid a useless dependency if debian/cw/usr/bin/cwgen debian/cw/usr/bin/cw were not linked against libm.so.6 (they use none of the library's symbols)
dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: package could avoid a useless dependency if debian/cwcp/usr/bin/cwcp was not linked against libm.so.6 (it uses none of the library's symbols)

** TODO [#B] R0011 Space in xcwcp
Double-check if the first character added to text area in xcwcp is a space. If it is, then fix it.
** TODO [#B] R0012 Slope duration for tones at highest speeds
For tones at highest speeds the current tone slope duration may be too long,
and the tones may be malformed. The duration may have to be shortened.
** TODO [#B] R0013 Correct source of frequency in console code
libcw tests that should generate varying frequency (like
legacy_api_test_cw_queue_tone()) don't generate the varying
frequencies for console sound system. This is probably related to
where cw_console_write_tone_to_sound_device_internal() gets frequency
argument from.

This doesn't have impact on cw/cwcp/xcwcp, but should be fixed
nevertheless.

** TODO [#B] R0014 Integrate contents of recent debian/ directory
Use contents of the latest files from debian.org.

** TODO [#C] R0016 Add to configure.ac a check for GNU make on build machine

unixcw's Makefiles may not work with non-GNU make on non Linux machines.

2023.11.12 acerion: no problems observed with recent Alpine and FreeBSD, so

** TODO [#B] R0024 Each failed test should be logged to file
Having the failed tests logged to a file will make it easier to track
problems and come back to them later. Right now all we have is a long,
long log of tests (where both successful and failed tests are printed)
and a test summary table. The full log is too long, and the summary
table is not detailed enough.

The separate log file with only failed tests (full logs of failed
tests) would be a useful middle ground.

This would require buffering of a test in memory and dumping it to
file on errors.
** TODO [#B] R0025 Count ALSA errors in tests framework:
 + write: writei: Input/output error / -5
 + underruns
 + other
This will require propagating them from libcw's ALSA module up to test
framework, but it would help a lot in registering and tracking problems.

** TODO [#C] R0026 Print summary table also to disc file
It will be easier to copy/paste test results on non-X systems from a
disc file to qa/test_scenarios/*.org.
** TODO [#B] R0027 Track failing tests
Learn how to recognize which functions fail, learn how to count their
failures and track them over time and over OSes. Perhaps each test should
have its unique id that would be preserved even if a test function was
renamed or split.

2023.11.12: this is useful when you want to recognize if the failures you see
today are the same failures that you saw in the previous release.

*2023.11.11: this is happening on FreeBSD 13.2 with OSS too*

The divergence for first element is always very high. This leads to falure of
this and other functions (test_cw_gen_enqueue_character_no_ics,
test_cw_gen_remove_last_character).

** TODO [#A] R0029 Add code checkers tests
Add to test scenarios in qa/test_scenarios/. a "run clang-tidy and cppcheck"
test for each platform and each package.

** TODO [#C] R0030 Fix long duration of valgrind tests
When libcw tests binary is executed under valgrind, its execution
takes a lot of time because the tests call vsnprintf() a lot
(indirectly through snprintf() and vsnprintf()). We can really shorten
the duration of tests if only we will find a way to decrease usage of
these functions.
** TODO [#C] R0031 Implement a fully automatic testing of cwgen's output
Pass to cwgen all combinations of command line args, and examine if
cwgen's output is generating what is requested. Also check randomness
of output.

2023.11.12 acerion: automatic test added in
03066d8dc55057bee412a2ccd4811297335bd579 generates random combinations of
command line options, but it still can be improved. Because we now have some
basic form of fix for this, I'm specifying prio as #C.

** TODO [#B] R0032 Test of installation and usage of library
Add following manual/semiautomatic test to test scenarios of unixcw:
1. Compile the install unixcw:
./configure --prefix=$HOME && make && make install
2. Compile cwdaemon using libcw headers and library installed in
   $HOME.
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/lib/pkgconfig/ ./configure && make
3. Run cwdaemon using libcw library installed in $HOME.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib ./src/cwdaemon -x p -n
./examples/example.sh
** TODO [#B] R0033 Add 'build Debian package' test
Add "run 'build Debian package' test" to list of tests in qa/test_scenarios/.
** TODO [#C] R0034 Add qa/ script for reproducible Debian builds
https://manpages.debian.org/buster/reprotest/reprotest.1.en.html
** TODO [#B] R0035 Feature: remove cw_assert() from libcw

Replace it with dev debug message that is compiled only in dev builds.
** TODO [#B] R0036 Feature: run tests with dev features enabled
There are sections of code that are enabled only in dev builds: e.g. some
additional checks and safeguards. The unit/integration code must have a
chance at triggering these checks and safeguards.
** TODO [#C] R0037 Feature: non-hardcoded package version number

Right now the package number (e.g. 3.6.0) is explicitly given in many places
in the package. Come up with a way to at least decrease the count of places
where the number is hardcoded - use some #define or something like this.
** TODO [#C] R0038 Feature: changelogs in Debian packages
Debian packages contain changelog files that describe user-facing changes.
The files are somehow taken from unixcw package, but are now outdated. Do
something to make them up-to-date.

Example file: cwcp_3.6.1-1_amd64.deb/CONTENTS/usr/share/doc/cwcp/changelog.gz
** TODO [#B] R0039 'warn unused return value'

During building of Debian packages I noticed a compiler warning:

    warning: ignoring return value of ‘write’ declared with attribute ‘warn_unused_result’ [-Wunused-result]

Why this issue was not found earlier? Am I missing some compiler warning in
my flags?

It may be required to set -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1 (or =2) to see this warning
during compilation time.

** TODO [#A] R0040 Add more compilation flags

Generic: -Wunused -Wsign-conversion -Wmisleading-indentation -Wduplicated-branches -Walloc-zero -Wconversion -Wformat-signedness -Wuninitialized -Winit-self -Wundef -Wunused-macros -Wstrict-aliasing -Wattributes -Wmain -Wpointer-arith -Wunused-result

C: -Wimplicit-int -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Wint-conversion -Wpointer-sign -Wincompatible-pointer-types -Wold-style-definition

C++: -Woverloaded-virtual -Wuseless-cast -Wnarrowing -Wwrite-strings

For Debian: -Wdate-time

** TODO [#A] R0041 Bump value of -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE from 1 to 2

configure.ac specifies this macro for C and for C++, but with value of '1'.
Increase the value to '2' and do lots of tests to ensure that no run-time
errors occur.

** TODO [#B] R0042 Clean up compilation flags in configure.ac

Right now the section of code in configure.ac that adds compilation flags
(-Wxyz) is messy. Clean it up. Remove sections related to unsupported
compilers - you can't test them anyway.

** TODO [#A] R0043 QA in README and NEWS

1. Add to README some information about QA mechanisms in the package:
 - automatic tests of libcw and other components,
 - static code analysis,
 - compiler flags,
 - other

2. Add to prerelease checklist some steps that will require:
 - reviewing of recent QA changes and adding them to NEWS file,
 - reviewing of recent QA changes and updating QA section in README.

Let users of unixcw know that there is some QA effort put into this software.

There is already some description of QA measures in src/libcw/tests/README.
Move the description out of that file.

** TODO [#C] R0044 print CXXFLAGS in configure.ac

RELATED TO R0054.

Print value of CXXFLAGS the same way that you print value of CFLAGS in
summary of ./configure script.

** TODO [#A] R0045 use receiver in legacy_api_test_gen_remove_last_character

Use receiver in legacy_api_test_gen_remove_last_character() test function to
receive played string and to confirm that characters have been removed. The
receiver is used in tests of related 'modern API' function
test_cw_gen_remove_last_character().

** TODO [#A] R0046 Improve timing characteristics of PulseAudio

Results of libcw 'test_cw_gen_state_callback' test for PulseAudio are very
poor, especially for higher generator's speeds. Find out why the results are
so bad and fix the root cause.

** TODO [#B] R0047 Use standard solution for command line options

cw_cmdline.c is using a solution that looks like a non-standard approach to
defining command line options:
""s:|system,d:|device,w:|wpm,t:|tone,v:|volume,1:|alsa-period-size..."

Replace it with getopt(), getopt_long(), 'struct option long_options[]' and
such.

** TODO [#B] R0048 No pause between libcw tests

Each test in libcw test binary is preceded by a short (2-3 seconds) space.
This space is introduced to give a tester some time to read the test's
header/description.

This space is unnecessary (and annoying) when the tests are executed during
"make check". Add a flag that controls the space, and decrease time of
running of "make check" for libcw.

** TODO [#A] R0049 Add static code analysis with gcc -fanalyzer
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html

** TODO [#B] R0050 Add receiver functionality to cwcp
User has asked for similar "receiver" functionality as it exists in xcwcp,
where you can use either keyboard (Enter/Space/Up/Down keys) or mouse
Left/Right buttons) to simulate Morse key, and let a program interpret input
from the Morse key.

** TODO [#B] R0051 Fix console sound system on FreeBSD

Console sound system doesn't work on FreeBSD.

Trying to use vanilla code with /dev/console device doesn't work at all in FreeBSD 13.2.

Trying to define LIBCW_CONSOLE_USE_SPKRTONE and use /dev/speaker works only
partially: some of libcw tests pass, but other tests (e.g.
legacy_api_test_straight_key) do not (there is no sound at all).

** TODO [#A] R0052 test_cw_tq_wait_for_level_internal on FreeBSD/OSS is failing

Fix the test, or understand why it fails.

** TODO [#C] R0053 proper use of LIBS in configure.ac

-lm, -lintl and perhaps other libs should be just added to LIBS in
 configure.ac. I think that current usage of LIBS in configure.ac is not
 standard one. Clean this up.

If you are afraid that some programs will link at run-time with unwanted
libraries (e.g. xcwpc linking with libintl even though xcwcp doesn't need
it), then this may point to an error in unixcw build system files.

** TODO [#C] R0054 print LIBS in configure.ac

BLOCKED BY R0053.
RELATED TO R0044.

Print value of LIBS the same way that you print value of CFLAGS in
summary of ./configure script.

** TODO [#A] R0055 prerelease checklist should be versioned

This document: qa/prerelease_checklist.org.

Just like the test scenarios are versioned.

Each release should have its own permanent document with assigned version.
